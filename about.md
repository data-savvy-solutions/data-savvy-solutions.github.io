An experienced data professional, I've had the opportunity to work across a range of diverse industries, such as technology, healthcare, local government and social housing. This breadth of experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of the unique data challenges and opportunities faced by different sectors, enabling me to offer tailored solutions that drive tangible business outcomes.

With over a decade of hands-on experience in the data domain, I bring a wealth of knowledge, insights, and practical know-how to every project I undertake. Whether it's optimising data infrastructure, designing and implementing robust data pipelines or architecting scalable data warehouse solutions, I've been involved in every stage of the data life cycle.

My technical skill set encompasses proficiency in a wide array of tools and technologies, and I've often worked within cross-functional teams, colloborating closely with Data Scientists, Business Analysts, and Software Engineers. This collaborative approach has been instrumental in delivering data solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also align with broader business objectives.

I understand that navigating the complexities of Data Engineering projects can be daunting, which is why I strive to provide not only exceptional technical expertise but also valuable advice and guidance throughout our engagement. My commitment to your project's success means that I'll always be there to offer insights, recommendations, and support every step of the way.
